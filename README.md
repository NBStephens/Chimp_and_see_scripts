# Chimp and See Zooniverse Scripts
Series of python scripts that can be used to interact with the Chimp and See project hosted on Zoonivere

### Installing
Scripts are designed to work with python 3.6+ and pandas 1.0+ in either Windows or Linux.
Aside from this you will need access to the master Google spread sheet. 
You can install the package gspread_pandas (https://gspread-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) using pip 
from a terminal:

```
pip install gspread-pandas
```
